PythTB is a Python toolkit for constructing and analyzing tight-binding models. It provides a flexible interface for exploring electronic structure and band topology in both simple and research-scale systems. With PythTB, you can:

- Build models for crystals, slabs, ribbons, and molecules - any combination of periodic and open directions.
- Sweep adiabatic parameters and evaluate band structure, quantum geometric tensors, local Chern markers, and axion angles.
- Compute Berry phases, Berry curvature, Chern numbers, Wilson loops, and other band-topology diagnostics on structured meshes.
- Interface with Wannier90 to construct tight-binding models from first-principles calculations.

Whether you are prototyping a textbook model or conducting research, PythTB is designed to remain readable, reproducible, and easy to extend.
