PythTB is a Python library for constructing and analyzing tight-binding models, built for modern topological band theory applications. It provides a streamlined path from model specification to physical interpretation, making it useful for both learning electronic structure and conducting research-level studies. With only a few lines of code, you can define lattice models, build tight-binding Hamiltonians, and compute electronic properties.

PythTB provides tools for:
- Band structures and density of states
- Berry phases and Berry curvature
- Chern numbers, Wilson loops, and related invariants
- Quantum geometric tensors and local Chern markers
- Chern-Simons axion angle
- Maximally localized Wannier functions
- Wannier-based tight-binding models generated through Wannier90
