`PythTB` is a software package providing a Python implementation of the tight-binding approximation. 
It can be used to construct and solve tight-binding models of the electronic structure of systems of 
arbitrary dimensionality (crystals, slabs, ribbons, clusters, etc.), and is rich with features for computing 
Berry phases and related properties. For more details, please see the [documentation](https://pythtb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
